            "\n",
            "*   **What it is:** This test checks for antibodies against bacteria that cause typhoid fever (S. Typhi) and paratyphoid fever (S. Paratyphi). Antibodies are proteins your body produces to fight infection.\n",
            "*   **S. Typhi \"O\" and \"H\":** These refer to different types of antibodies against *Salmonella Typhi*, the main bacteria causing typhoid.  \"O\" and \"H\" are specific antigens (parts of the bacteria that the antibodies recognize).\n",
            "*   **S. Paratyphi \"AH\" and \"BH\":** These refer to different types of antibodies against *Salmonella Paratyphi*, which causes paratyphoid fever (a milder form of typhoid).\n",
            "*   **1:160, 1:80, 1:20 Dilution:** This represents the *titer* or amount of antibody found in the blood.  A higher number (like 1:160) *suggests* a higher level of antibodies. The normal value is 1:20. So, S.Typhi \"O\" is elevated (1:160), while \"H\" is at 1:80.\n",
            "*   **In simple terms:** The results *suggest* a possible typhoid infection or a recent past infection with typhoid. However, Widal tests can be unreliable, and these results need to be interpreted cautiously by the doctor. Further investigations might be needed.\n",

            "*   **Dengue NS1 Antigen:** This protein is present in the blood early in a dengue infection.\n",
            "*   **Dengue IgG and IgM:** These are antibodies that appear at different stages of a dengue infection. IgM usually shows up first, indicating a recent infection, while IgG appears later and can indicate a past infection or immunity.\n",
            "*   **Negative:** This means the test did not detect the virus or antibodies for dengue fever in Mr. Goud's sample.\n",

            "\n",

            "*   **mm/hr:** Millimeters per hour.  This is the unit of measurement.\n",
            "*   **Elevated Result (26 mm/hr and 52 mm/hr):** A higher ESR usually indicates inflammation, infection, or other conditions in the body. The reference range is 0-8 mm/hr.\n",
            "*   **In simple terms:** Mr. Goud's ESR is higher than normal, suggesting some inflammation in his body. This test *doesn't* tell *what* is causing the inflammation, but it's a clue for the doctor to investigate further.\n",
